# Philosophers, the concurrency project (School 42 project)
A classic problem in concurrency and multithreading, inspired by Edsger Dijkstra's Dining Philosophers problem. The project is designed to learn about thread synchronization, race conditions, mutexes, and deadlocks.

**N philosophers are sitting around a circular table. Each philosopher follows a simple routine:**

Think 🤔
Pick up two forks (one on the left, one on the right) to eat 🍽️
Eat for a while 😋
Put the forks down and go back to thinking 🔄

**The challenge arises because:**

    Each philosopher has only one fork on their left and one on their right.
    There are exactly N forks for N philosophers.
    If all philosophers pick up one fork at the same time, they will deadlock (waiting forever for the second fork).

**Goals of the Project**

    Implement a simulation of this problem using threads.
    Ensure that:
        No philosopher starves (i.e., they eventually eat).
        The program avoids deadlocks.
        The output logs each philosopher’s actions (thinking, eating, sleeping).
    Use mutexes or other synchronization techniques to prevent race conditions.

**Project Requirements**

    Use C language.
    Implement the solution using pthread library (POSIX threads).
    Handle edge cases:
        One philosopher (who can never eat because they need two forks).
        Minimum and maximum philosophers.
        Proper cleanup of resources (threads and mutexes).

**Common Issues & Debugging**

    Race conditions: If multiple threads modify shared data without proper locking.
    Deadlocks: If all philosophers pick up one fork and wait for the second.
    Starvation: If some philosophers get to eat repeatedly while others never do.

## Known issues 🚨
TBA
<!--1. macOS not working out of the box (the project was written on Linux Ubuntu)
1. Lack of z-buffer – resulting in line overlay problems (best seen on big maps like ./maps/t1.fdf)
1. Due to the limitation of the MLX library, the control panel text is output to the window, not the image.
This sometimes results in blinking (because of the constant rerendering).
However, it perfectly shows why we should use the image pre-render for the main part of the program.
It's best to reimplement this functionality with using an XPM image-->
